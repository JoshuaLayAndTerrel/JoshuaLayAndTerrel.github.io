    <h1>Welcome to the homepage of BattleBrawlers.</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>the employers and jobs.</li>
    
    <body>
        <p>To start off, I think i'll label the existing jobs. BTW WE ARE NOT HIRING!!!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The card designer.
                The card designer creates a design for a card, cuts it out and then it is a usable card.
                If there are not enough cards, then it is the designers fault for laying off the production.
            </li>
            <li>The card pack maker.
                One of the less important jobs, the pack maker creates a4 paper envelopes that can hold enough cards.
                The reason these are less important is because they are not needed, the cards could be given without a pack,
                but so more people buy them.
            </li>
            <li> Manager.
                This role is to make sure that people are doing enough work.Without this role there would be no company at all.
                The two people who enroll this are Joshua (He does every role) and Terrel (He keeps force to the managers and keeps people working)
